/**
 * CHANGE THE PLATFORM SAAS BILLING START DATE HERE.
 *
 * Midnight UTC on this calendar day is the first due date: complimentary
 * access ends and unpaid lead sponsors must pay. After a deal is on a
 * Stripe subscription, next billing dates come from Stripe — this value
 * is not reused as the renewal date.
 *
 * The Settings → Billing date picker is commented out; every company and
 * deal uses this value for that first due date only.
 *
 * Edit year / month / day below (month is 1–12, not 0-based).
